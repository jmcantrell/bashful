# <doc:bashful-terminfo>
#
# The terminfo library provides variables for altering the appearance of
# terminal output (bold, standout, underline, colors, etc).
#
# If available to the terminal, the 8 standard color names are loaded
# initially, along with things like bold, underline, etc.
#
# It's recommended that any access to colors/formatting be used through these
# convenience functions:
#
# These functions will print text in a given color. One handles foreground,
# the other handles background. Any colors beyond the standard 8 are loaded on
# first access and cached for later use.
#
# Usage examples:
#     FG green "This foreground is green"
#     BG black "This background is black"
#     FG green "$(BG black "This text is green and black")"
#
# Although, if you don't care about any colors beyond the first 8 named ones,
# you could just as easily do:
#
#     echo "${term_fg_green}${term_bg_black}TEXT${term_reset}"
#
# This is also true for the formatting strings below (reset, bold, etc).
#
# You can also use numbered colors from 1 to the maximum number your terminal
# supports.
#
#     FG 255 "This foreground is whatever 255 is"
#
# In addition to the FG and BG functions, there's also a function that will
# apply formatting options like bold, underline, etc.
#
#     FX FORMAT TEXT
#
# Where FORMAT is one of:
#
#     reset
#     bold
#     dim
#     standout
#     italic
#     underline
#     blink
#     reverse
#
# Don't be surprised if a lot of the formatting strings don't work. 99% of the
# time, it's because your terminal doesn't support it, or you don't have the
# right TERM setting. My best advice is to use xterm and set TERM to
# xterm-256color.
